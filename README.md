### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior data scientist at Novo Nordisk.

Prior to this I did my PhD in statistical genetics at King's College London, analysing huge epidemiological datasets using genomic data science/causal inference methods, focusing on self-harm and its risk factors. 

My passion lies in health data science and statistical genetics. 

I use R, git, Linux/Unix, High Performance Computing (HPC), and am familiar with Python and SQL.

## My recent projects
1. [Health Data Science Resources](https://github.com/kai-lim/Health-data-science-resources) 
 
I curate a list of resources related to health data science

2. Target Trial Emulation (TTE)

In this repo, I aim to populate the resources related to TTE that I find helpful.
