### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year PhD student in statistical genetics at King's College London. 

Based in an interdisciplinary research setting, I analyse huge epidemiological datasets using genomic data science/causal inference methods, focusing on self-harm and its risk factors. My passion lies in statistical genetics, health and data science. 

I use R, git, Linux/Unix, High Performance Computing (HPC), and am familiar with Python and SQL.
