### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist at Roche.

Prior to this I did my PhD in statistical genetics at King's College London, analysing huge epidemiological datasets using genomic data science/causal inference methods, focusing on self-harm and its risk factors. 

My passion lies in health data science and statistical genetics. 

I use R, git, Linux/Unix, High Performance Computing (HPC), and am familiar with Python and SQL.
